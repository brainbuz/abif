Please contribute!  We'll figure out the details later!  :-)

### Changelog/Notes
Below is a reverse-chronological log of changes to this policy.

#### 2021-06-13

We need to solve a few things before accepting serious contributions:

* Copyright: what license will the reference implementation be under?  Probably MIT, but there's at least a couple of scenarios where [@robla](https://github.com/robla) could imagine Apache of even AGPL to be more appropriate.
* Copyright assignment: do we need this?
* Patent policy: do we need to make sure we aren't subject to stealth patenting of our work here?
